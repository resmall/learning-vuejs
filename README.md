## Task list - Learning app

This is a very simple todo list I'm developing to learn Vue.js.

I'll try to cover every aspect of Vue following it's guide which is found here: http://vuejs.org/guide/

Every aspect of the guide will be separated using tags. Every tag will contain a working commit that adds and demonstrates that aspect of Vue.
